# Guide to Entering Patient Data

This form is designed to capture the key characteristics of a patient that the machine learning model uses to predict their annual healthcare expenditure. Hereâ€™s what each field means:

---

### 1. Age

*   **Example:** `45`

### 2. Sex
*   **What it is:** The patient's biological sex.
*   **How to enter:** Select an option from the dropdown menu. The application automatically converts this to the required numeric code for the model (`1` for Male, `2` for Female).
*   **Example:** Select `Male` from the dropdown.

### 3. Race (Code)
*   **What it is:** A numeric code representing the patient's race and ethnicity, based on the standard codes used in the MEPS dataset.
*   **How to enter:** You need to enter the specific number code that corresponds to a category. Since the model was trained on these codes, using the correct one is important. Common codes from this dataset are:
    *   `1`: Hispanic
    *   `2`: Non-Hispanic White
    *   `3`: Non-Hispanic Black
    *   `4`: Non-Hispanic Asian

    *   `2`: Near Poor (Just above the poverty line)
    *   `3`: Low Income
    *   `4`: Middle Income

*   **Example:** `4` represents a middle-income patient.

### 5. Insurance Coverage (1-3)
